Introduction

Beginning July 1, 2014 these Online Services Terms (OST) replace the Online
Services Use Rights (OLSUR). The OST contains terms that apply to Customer’s use
of Online Services. Separate terms, including different privacy and security
terms, govern Customer’s use of Non-Microsoft Products (as defined below), as
well as other products and services from Microsoft.

Most Online Services offer a Service Level Agreement (SLA). For more information
regarding the Online Services SLAs, please refer to
<http://microsoft.com/licensing/contracts>.

Prior Versions

The OST provides terms for Online Services that are currently available. For
earlier versions Customer may refer to <http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9840733>
or contact its reseller or Microsoft Account Manager.

[Table of Contents](#TableofContents) / [General Terms](#GeneralTerms)

General Terms

Customer may use the Online Services and related software as expressly permitted
in Customer’s volume licensing agreement. Microsoft reserves all other rights.
Customer must acquire and assign the appropriate subscription licenses required
for its use of each Online Service. Each user that accesses the Online Service
must be assigned a User SL or access the Online Service only through a device
that has been assigned a Device SL, unless specified otherwise in the [Online
Service-specific Terms](#OnlineServiceSpecificTerms). [Attachment
2](#Attachment2) describes SL Suites that also fulfill requirements for User
SLs. Customer has no right to use an Online Service after the SL for that Online
Service ends.

Definitions

If any of the terms below are not defined in Customer’s volume licensing
agreement, they have the definitions below.

“Customer Data” means all data, including all text, sound, video, or image
files, and software, that are provided to Microsoft by, or on behalf of,
Customer through use of the Online Service.

“External User” means a user of an Online Service that is not an employee,
onsite contractor, or onsite agent of Customer or its Affiliates.

“Instance” means an image of software that is created by executing the
software’s setup or install procedure or by duplicating such an image.

“Licensed Device” means the single physical hardware system to which a license
is assigned. For purposes of this definition, a hardware partition or blade is
considered to be a separate device.

“Non-Microsoft Product” means any third-party-branded software, data, service,
website or product, unless incorporated by Microsoft in an Online Service.

“Online Service” means a Microsoft-hosted service to which Customer subscribes
under a Microsoft volume licensing agreement, including any service identified
in the Online Services section of the Product Terms. It does not include
software and services provided under separate license terms (such as via
gallery, marketplace, console, or dialog). The Product Terms is located at
<http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9839207>.

“Operating System Environment” (OSE) means all or part of an operating system
Instance, or all or part of a virtual (or otherwise emulated) operating system
Instance, that enables separate machine identity (primary computer name or
similar unique identifier) or separate administrative rights, and Instances of
applications, if any, configured to run on all or part of that operating system
Instance. There are two types of OSEs, physical and virtual. A physical hardware
system can have one physical OSE and/or one or more virtual OSEs. The operating
system Instance used to run hardware virtualization software or to provide
hardware virtualization services is considered part of the physical OSE.

“Personal Data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable
natural person. An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified,
directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a
name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or
more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic,
cultural or social identity of that natural person.

“SL” means subscription license.

“Support Data” means all data, including all text, sound, video, image files, or
software, that are provided to Microsoft by or on behalf of Customer (or that
Customer authorizes Microsoft to obtain from an Online Service) through an
engagement with Microsoft to obtain technical support for Online Services
covered under this agreement.

Online Services Terms Updates

When Customer renews or purchases a new subscription to an Online Service, the
then-current OST will apply and will not change during Customer’s subscription
for that Online Service. When Microsoft introduces features, supplements or
related software that are new (i.e., that were not previously included with the
subscription), Microsoft may provide terms or make updates to the OST that apply
to Customer’s use of those new features, supplements or related software.

Online Services Changes and Availability

Microsoft may make commercially reasonable changes to each Online Service from
time to time. Microsoft may modify or terminate an Online Service in any country
where Microsoft is subject to a government regulation, obligation or other
requirement that (1) is not generally applicable to businesses operating there,
(2) presents a hardship for Microsoft to continue operating the Online Service
without modification, and/or (3) causes Microsoft to believe these terms or the
Online Service may conflict with any such requirement or obligation. If
Microsoft terminates an Online Service for regulatory reasons, Customers will
receive a credit for any amount paid in advance for the period after
termination.

Availability, functionality, and language versions for each Online Service may
vary by country. For information on availability, Customer may refer to
[www.microsoft.com/online/international-availability.aspx](http://www.microsoft.com/online/international-availability.aspx).

Data Retention

At all times during the term of Customer’s subscription, Customer will have the
ability to access and extract Customer Data stored in each Online Service.
Except for free trials and LinkedIn services, Microsoft will retain Customer
Data stored in the Online Service in a limited function account for 90 days
after expiration or termination of Customer’s subscription so that Customer may
extract the data. After the 90-day retention period ends, Microsoft will disable
Customer’s account and delete the Customer Data.

The Online Service may not support retention or extraction of software provided
by Customer. Microsoft has no liability for the deletion of Customer Data as
described in this section.

Use of Software with the Online Service

Customer may need to install certain Microsoft software in order to use the
Online Service. If so, the following terms apply:

>   **Microsoft Software License Terms**

>   Customer may install and use the software only for use with the Online
>   Service. The [Online Service-specific Terms](#OnlineServiceSpecificTerms)
>   may limit the number of copies of the software Customer may use or the
>   number of devices on which Customer may use it. Customer’s right to use the
>   software begins when the Online Service is activated and ends when
>   Customer’s right to use the Online Service ends. Customer must uninstall the
>   software when Customer’s right to use it ends. Microsoft may disable it at
>   that time.

>   **Validation, Automatic Updates, and Collection for Software**

>   Microsoft may automatically check the version of any of its software.
>   Devices on which the software is installed may periodically provide
>   information to enable Microsoft to verify that the software is properly
>   licensed. This information includes the software version, the end user’s
>   user account, product ID information, a machine ID, and the internet
>   protocol address of the device. If the software is not properly licensed,
>   its functionality will be affected. Customer may only obtain updates or
>   upgrades for the software from Microsoft or authorized sources. By using the
>   software, Customer consents to the transmission of the information described
>   in this section. Microsoft may recommend or download to Customer’s devices
>   updates or supplements to this software, with or without notice. Some Online
>   Services may require, or may be enhanced by, the installation of local
>   software (e.g., agents, device management applications) (“Apps”). The Apps
>   may collect data about the use and performance of the Apps, which may be
>   transmitted to Microsoft and used for the purposes described in this OST for
>   Customer Data.

>   **Third-party Software Components**

>   The software may contain third party software components. Unless otherwise
>   disclosed in that software, Microsoft, not the third party, licenses these
>   components to Customer under Microsoft’s license terms and notices.

Non-Microsoft Products

Microsoft may make Non-Microsoft Products available to Customer through
Customer’s use of the Online Services (such as through a store or gallery, or as
search results) or a Microsoft online store (such as the Microsoft Store for
Business or Microsoft Store for Education). If Customer installs or uses any
Non-Microsoft Product with an Online Service, Customer may not do so in any way
that would subject Microsoft’s intellectual property or technology to
obligations beyond those expressly included in Customer’s volume licensing
agreement. For Customer’s convenience, Microsoft may include charges for certain
Non-Microsoft Product as part of Customer’s bill for Online Services. Microsoft,
however, assumes no responsibility or liability whatsoever for any Non-Microsoft
Product. Customer is solely responsible for any Non-Microsoft Product that it
installs or uses with an Online Service or acquires or manages through a
Microsoft online store. Customer’s use of any Non-Microsoft Product shall be
governed by the license, service, and/or privacy terms between Customer and the
publisher of the Non-Microsoft Product (if any).

Acceptable Use Policy

Neither Customer, nor those that access an Online Service through Customer, may
use an Online Service:

-   in a way prohibited by law, regulation, governmental order or decree;

-   to violate the rights of others;

-   to try to gain unauthorized access to or disrupt any service, device, data,
    account or network;

-   to spam or distribute malware;

-   in a way that could harm the Online Service or impair anyone else’s use of
    it; or

-   in any application or situation where failure of the Online Service could
    lead to the death or serious bodily injury of any person, or to severe
    physical or environmental damage.

Violation of the terms in this section may result in suspension of the Online
Service. Microsoft will suspend the Online Service only to the extent reasonably
necessary. Unless Microsoft believes an immediate suspension is required,
Microsoft will provide reasonable notice before suspending an Online Service.

Technical Limitations

Customer must comply with, and may not work around, any technical limitations in
an Online Service that only allow Customer to use it in certain ways. Customer
may not download or otherwise remove copies of software or source code from an
Online Service except as explicitly authorized.

Compliance with Laws

Microsoft will comply with all laws and regulations applicable to its provision
of the Online Services, including security breach notification law. However,
Microsoft is not responsible for compliance with any laws or regulations
applicable to Customer or Customer’s industry that are not generally applicable
to information technology service providers. Microsoft does not determine
whether Customer Data or Support Data include information subject to any
specific law or regulation. All Security Incidents are subject to the Security
Incident Notification terms below.

Customer must comply with all laws and regulations applicable to its use of
Online Services, including laws related to privacy, Personal Data, biometric
data, data protection and confidentiality of communications. Customer is
responsible for implementing and maintaining privacy protections and security
measures for components that Customer provides or controls (such as devices
enrolled with Microsoft Intune or within a Microsoft Azure customer’s virtual
machine or application), determining whether the Online Services are appropriate
for storage and processing of information subject to any specific law or
regulation, and for using the Online Services in a manner consistent with
Customer’s legal and regulatory obligations. Customer is responsible for
responding to any request from a third party regarding Customer’s use of an
Online Service, such as a request to take down content under the U.S. Digital
Millennium Copyright Act or other applicable laws.

Import/Export Services

Customer’s use of any Import/Export Service is conditioned upon its compliance
with all instructions provided by Microsoft regarding the preparation, treatment
and shipment of physical media containing its data (“storage media”). Customer
is solely responsible for ensuring the storage media and data are provided in
compliance with all laws and regulations. Microsoft has no duty with respect to
the storage media and no liability for lost, damaged or destroyed storage media.
All storage media shipped to Microsoft must be shipped DAP Microsoft DCS Data
Center (INCOTERMS 2010). Storage media shipped to Customer will be shipped DAP
Customer Dock (INCOTERMS 2010).

Electronic Notices

Microsoft may provide Customer with information and notices about Online
Services electronically, including via email, through the portal for the Online
Service, or through a web site that Microsoft identifies. Notice is given as of
the date it is made available by Microsoft.

License Reassignment

Most, but not all, SLs may be reassigned. Except as permitted in this paragraph
or in the [Online Service-specific Terms](#OnlineServiceSpecificTerms), Customer
may not reassign an SL on a short-term basis (i.e., within 90 days of the last
assignment). Customer may reassign an SL on a short-term basis to cover a user’s
absence or the unavailability of a device that is out of service. Reassignment
of an SL for any other purpose must be permanent. When Customer reassigns an SL
from one device or user to another, Customer must block access and remove any
related software from the former device or from the former user’s device.

Font Components

While Customer uses an Online Service, Customer may use the fonts installed by
that Online Service to display and print content. Customer may only embed fonts
in content as permitted by the embedding restrictions in the fonts and
temporarily download them to a printer or other output device to print content.

Competitive Benchmarking

If Customer offers a service competitive to an Online Service, by using the
Online Service, Customer agrees to waive any restrictions on competitive use and
benchmark testing in the terms governing its competitive service. If Customer
does not intend to waive such restrictions in its terms of use, Customer is not
allowed to use the Online Service.

Multiplexing

Hardware or software that Customer uses to pool connections; reroute
information; reduce the number of devices or users that directly access or use
the Online Service (or related software); or reduce the number of OSEs, devices
or users the Online Service directly manages (sometimes referred to as
“multiplexing” or “pooling”) does not reduce the number of licenses of any type
(including SLs) that Customer needs.

[Table of Contents](#TableofContents) / [General Terms](#GeneralTerms)

Privacy and Security Terms

This section of the Online Services Terms has two parts:

-   General Privacy and Security Terms, which apply to all Online Services; and

-   Data Processing Terms, which are additional commitments for certain Online
    Services.

General Privacy and Security Terms

Scope

The terms in this section apply to all Online Services except Bing Maps
Enterprise Platform, Bing Maps Mobile Asset Management Platform, LinkedIn Sales
Navigator, Microsoft Cognitive Services, Microsoft Azure Stack, Microsoft
Genomics, and Visual Studio App Center, which are governed by the privacy and/or
security terms referenced below in the applicable [Online Service-specific
Terms](#OnlineServiceSpecificTerms).

Use of Customer Data

Customer Data will be used only to provide Customer the Online Services
including purposes compatible with providing those services. Microsoft will not
use Customer Data or derive information from it for any advertising or similar
commercial purposes. As between the parties, Customer retains all right, title
and interest in and to Customer Data. Microsoft acquires no rights in Customer
Data, other than the rights Customer grants to Microsoft to provide the Online
Services to Customer. This paragraph does not affect Microsoft’s rights in
software or services Microsoft licenses to Customer.

Processing of Personal Data

Article 28(1) of the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”)
requires an agreement between a controller and processor, and between a
processor and subprocessor, that processing be conducted in accordance with
technical and organizational measures that meet the requirements of the GDPR and
ensure the protection of the rights of data subjects. The GDPR Terms in
Attachment 4 are intended to satisfy that requirement for the parties. The GDPR
Terms are organized as follows:

-   Section C reproduces (with minor edits for clarity) the relevant contractual
    terms required of processors and controllers by Articles 28, 32, and 33 of
    the GDPR.

-   Appendix 1 provides more details on what Customer can expect from Microsoft
    to fulfill those terms, as well as Microsoft’s commitments with regard to
    Articles 30 and 34-36 of the GDPR.

Microsoft makes the commitments in the GDPR Terms to all customers effective May
25, 2018.

Use of Support Data

Support Data will be used only to provide Customer with support, including
purposes compatible with providing support, such as troubleshooting recurring
issues and improvements to support or to the Online Services. Microsoft will not
use Support Data or derive information from it for advertising or similar
commercial purposes without Customer’s permission. As between the parties,
Customer retains all right, title and interest in and to Support Data. Microsoft
acquires no rights in Support Data, other than the rights Customer grants to
Microsoft to provide support to Customer. This paragraph does not affect
Microsoft’s rights in software or services Microsoft licenses to Customer.

Disclosure of Customer Data and Support Data

Microsoft will not disclose Customer Data or Support Data outside of Microsoft
or its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates except (1) as Customer directs,
(2) as described in the OST, or (3) as required by law.

Microsoft will not disclose Customer Data or Support Data to law enforcement
unless required by law. If law enforcement contacts Microsoft with a demand for
Customer Data or Support Data, Microsoft will attempt to redirect the law
enforcement agency to request that data directly from Customer. If compelled to
disclose Customer Data or Support Data to law enforcement, Microsoft will
promptly notify Customer and provide a copy of the demand unless legally
prohibited from doing so.

Upon receipt of any other third party request for Customer Data or Support Data,
Microsoft will promptly notify Customer unless prohibited by law. Microsoft will
reject the request unless required by law to comply. If the request is valid,
Microsoft will attempt to redirect the third party to request the data directly
from Customer.

Microsoft will not provide any third party: (a) direct, indirect, blanket or
unfettered access to Customer Data or Support Data; (b) platform encryption keys
used to secure Customer Data or the ability to break such encryption; or
(c) access to Customer Data or Support Data if Microsoft is aware that the data
is to be used for purposes other than those stated in the third party’s request.

In support of the above, Microsoft may provide Customer’s basic contact
information to the third party.

Educational Institutions

If Customer is an educational agency or institution to which regulations under
the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, 20 U.S.C. § 1232g (FERPA) apply,
Microsoft acknowledges that for the purposes of the OST, Microsoft is a “school
official” with “legitimate educational interests” in the Customer Data and
Support Data, as those terms have been defined under FERPA and its implementing
regulations, and Microsoft agrees to abide by the limitations and requirements
imposed by 34 CFR 99.33(a) on school officials.

Customer understands that Microsoft may possess limited or no contact
information for Customer’s students and students’ parents. Consequently,
Customer will be responsible for obtaining any parental consent for any end
user’s use of the Online Service that may be required by applicable law and to
convey notification on behalf of Microsoft to students (or, with respect to a
student under 18 years of age and not in attendance at a postsecondary
institution, to the student’s parent) of any judicial order or lawfully-issued
subpoena requiring the disclosure of Customer Data or Support Data in
Microsoft’s possession as may be required under applicable law.

HIPAA Business Associate

If Customer is a “covered entity” or a “business associate” and includes
"protected health information" in Customer Data as those terms are defined in 45
CFR § 160.103, execution of Customer’s volume licensing agreement includes
execution of the HIPAA Business Associate Agreement (“BAA”), the full text of
which identifies the Online Services to which it applies and is available at
<http://aka.ms/BAA>. Customer may opt out of the BAA by sending the following
information to Microsoft in a written notice (under the terms of the Customer’s
volume licensing agreement):

-   the full legal name of the Customer and any Affiliate that is opting out;

-    if Customer has multiple volume licensing agreements, the volume licensing
    agreement to which the opt out applies.

Security

Microsoft is committed to helping protect the security of Customer’s
information. Microsoft has implemented and will maintain and follow appropriate
technical and organizational measures intended to protect Customer Data and
Support Data against accidental, unauthorized or unlawful access, disclosure,
alteration, loss, or destruction.

Security Incident Notification

If Microsoft becomes aware of any unlawful access to any Customer Data or
Support Data stored on Microsoft’s equipment or in Microsoft’s facilities, or
unauthorized access to such equipment or facilities resulting in loss,
disclosure, or alteration of Customer Data or Support Data (each a “Security
Incident”), Microsoft will promptly (1) notify Customer of the Security
Incident; (2) investigate the Security Incident and provide Customer with
detailed information about the Security Incident; and (3) take reasonable steps
to mitigate the effects and to minimize any damage resulting from the Security
Incident.

Notification(s) of Security Incidents will be delivered to one or more of
Customer’s administrators by any means Microsoft selects, including via email.
It is Customer’s sole responsibility to ensure Customer’s administrators
maintain accurate contact information on each applicable Online Services portal.
Microsoft’s obligation to report or respond to a Security Incident under this
section is not an acknowledgement by Microsoft of any fault or liability with
respect to the Security Incident.

Customer must notify Microsoft promptly about any possible misuse of its
accounts or authentication credentials or any security incident related to an
Online Service.

Location of Data Processing

Except as described elsewhere in the OST, Customer Data and Support Data that
Microsoft processes on Customer’s behalf may be transferred to, and stored and
processed in, the United States or any other country in which Microsoft or its
affiliates or subcontractors maintain facilities. Customer appoints Microsoft to
perform any such transfer of Customer Data and Support Data to any such country
and to store and process Customer Data and Support Data in order to provide the
Online Services.

Microsoft will abide by the requirements of European Economic Area and Swiss
data protection law regarding the collection, use, transfer, retention, and
other processing of Personal Data from the European Economic Area and
Switzerland. Upon the start of enforcement of the GDPR, Microsoft will ensure
that transfers of Personal Data to a third country or an international
organization are subject to appropriate safeguards as described in Article 46 of
the GDPR and that such transfers and safeguards are documented according to
Article 30(2) of the GDPR. In addition to Microsoft’s commitments under the
Standard Contractual Clauses and other model contracts, Microsoft is certified
to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks and the commitments they
entail. Microsoft agrees to notify Customer in the event that it makes a
determination that it can no longer meet its obligation to provide the same
level of protection as is required by the Privacy Shield principles.

Preview Releases

Microsoft may offer preview, beta or other pre-release features, data center
locations, and services ("Previews") for optional evaluation. Unless otherwise
provided, (i) Previews employ lesser or different privacy and security measures
than those typically present in the Online Services, (ii) Previews are not
included in the SLA for the corresponding Online Service, and (iii) Customer
should not use Previews to process Personal Data or other data that is subject
to heightened compliance requirements.

Use of Subcontractors

Microsoft may hire subcontractors to provide services on its behalf. Any such
subcontractors will be permitted to obtain Customer Data and Support Data only
to deliver the services Microsoft has retained them to provide and will be
prohibited from using Customer Data and Support Data for any other purpose.
Microsoft remains responsible for its subcontractors’ compliance with
Microsoft’s obligations in the OST. Customer has previously consented to

Data Processing Terms

The Data Processing Terms (DPT) include the terms in this section.

The Data Processing Terms also include the “Standard Contractual Clauses,”
pursuant to the European Commission Decision of 5 February 2010 on standard
contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to processors established
in third countries under the EU Data Protection Directive. The Standard
Contractual Clauses are in [Attachment 3](#Attachment3). In addition,

-   Execution of the volume licensing agreement includes execution of
    [Attachment 3](#Attachment3), which is countersigned by Microsoft
    Corporation;

-   The terms in Customer’s volume licensing agreement, including the DPT,
    constitute a data processing agreement under which Microsoft is the data
    processor; and

-   The DPT control over any inconsistent or conflicting provision in Customer’s
    volume licensing agreement and, for each subscription, will remain in full
    force and effect until all of the related Customer Data is deleted from
    Microsoft’s systems in accordance with the DPT.

Customer may opt out of the “Standard Contractual Clauses” or the Data
Processing Terms in their entirety. To opt out, Customer must send the following
information to Microsoft in a written notice (under terms of the Customer’s
volume licensing agreement):

-   the full legal name of the Customer and any Affiliate that is opting out;

-   if Customer has multiple volume licensing agreements, the volume licensing
    agreement to which the Opt Out applies;

-   if opting out of the entire DPT, a statement that Customer (or Affiliate)
    opts out of the entirety of the Data Processing Terms; and

-   if opting out of only the Standard Contractual Clauses, a statement that
    Customer (or Affiliate) opts out of the Standard Contractual Clauses only.

In countries where regulatory approval is required for use of the Standard
Contractual Clauses, the Standard Contractual Clauses cannot be relied upon
under European Commission 2010/87/EU (of February 2010) to legitimize export of
data from the country, unless Customer has the required regulatory approval.

**In the DPT, the term “Online Services” applies only to the services in the
table below, excluding any Previews, and “Customer Data” includes only Customer
Data that is provided through use of those Online Services.**

Location of Customer Data at Rest

Microsoft will store Customer Data at rest within certain major geographic areas
(each, a Geo) as follows:

-   **Office 365 Services.** If Customer provisions its tenant in Australia,
    Canada, the European Union, India, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom,
    or the United States (each of the foregoing a Geo), Microsoft will store the
    following Customer Data at rest only within that Geo: (1) Exchange Online
    mailbox content (e-mail body, calendar entries, and the content of e-mail
    attachments), (2) SharePoint Online site content and the files stored within
    that site, and Project Online data, and (3) files uploaded to OneDrive for
    Business.

-   **Microsoft Intune Online Services**. When Customer provisions a tenant
    account, Customer selects an available Geo where Customer Data at rest will
    be stored. Microsoft will not transfer the Customer Data outside of
    Customer’s selected Geo except as noted in the “Data Location” section of
    the Microsoft Intune Trust Center.

-   **Microsoft Business Application Platform Core Services**. If Customer
    provisions its tenant in Australia, Canada, Asia Pacific, India, Japan, the
    European Union, United Kingdom (Power BI only), or the United States,
    Microsoft will store Customer Data at rest only within that Geo, except as
    noted in the data location section of the Microsoft Business Application
    Platform Trust Center.

-   **Microsoft Azure Core Services**. If Customer configures a particular
    service to be deployed within a Geo then, for that service, Microsoft will
    store Customer Data at rest within the specified Geo. Certain services may
    not enable Customer to configure deployment in a particular Geo or outside
    the United States and may store backups in other locations, as detailed in
    the Microsoft Azure Trust Center (which Microsoft may update from time to
    time, but Microsoft will not add exceptions for existing Services in general
    release).

-   **Microsoft Cloud App Security**. Microsoft will store Customer Data at rest
    in the United States.

-   **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Core Services**. Except for Microsoft Social
    Engagement, and only for entities managed by the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Core
    Services, if Customer provisions its instance of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Core
    Services in Australia, Canada, the European Union, India, Japan, the United
    Kingdom or the United States, Microsoft will store Customer Data at rest
    within the specified Geo. Certain entities may not be configured to be
    stored in any particular Geo and may be stored at rest in other locations as
    detailed in the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Trust Center.

Microsoft does not control or limit the regions from which Customer or
Customer’s end users may access or move Customer Data.

Privacy

-   **Customer Data Deletion or Return**. No more than 180 days after expiration
    or termination of Customer’s use of an Online Service, Microsoft will
    disable the account and delete Customer Data from the account.

-   **Transfer of Customer Data**. Unless Customer has opted out of the Standard
    Contractual Clauses, all transfers of Customer Data out of the European
    Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland shall be governed by the
    Standard Contractual Clauses. Microsoft will abide by the requirements of
    European Economic Area and Swiss data protection law regarding the
    collection, use, transfer, retention, and other processing of personal data
    from the European Economic Area and Switzerland.

-   **Microsoft Personnel**. Microsoft personnel will not process Customer Data
    without authorization from Customer. Microsoft personnel are obligated to
    maintain the security and secrecy of any Customer Data as provided in the
    DPT and this obligation continues even after their engagements end.

-   **Subcontractor Transfer**. Microsoft may hire subcontractors to provide
    certain limited or ancillary services on its behalf. Any subcontractors to
    whom Microsoft transfers Customer Data, even those used for storage
    purposes, will have entered into written agreements with Microsoft that are
    no less protective than the DPT. Customer has previously consented to
    Microsoft’s transfer of Customer Data to subcontractors as described in the
    DPT. Except as set forth in the DPT, or as Customer may otherwise authorize,
    Microsoft will not transfer to any third party (not even for storage
    purposes) personal data Customer provides to Microsoft through the use of
    the Online Services. Microsoft provides a website that lists subcontractors
    authorized to access Customer Data in the Online Services as well as the
    limited or ancillary services they provide. At least 6 months before
    authorizing any new subcontractor to access Customer Data, Microsoft will
    update the website and provide Customer with a mechanism to obtain notice of
    that update. If Customer does not approve of a new subcontractor, then
    Customer may terminate the affected Online Service without penalty by
    providing, before the end of the notice period, written notice of
    termination that includes an explanation of the grounds for non-approval. If
    the affected Online Service is part of a suite (or similar single purchase
    of services), then any termination will apply to the entire suite. After
    termination, Microsoft will remove payment obligations for the terminated
    Online Services from subsequent Customer invoices.

Additional European Terms.

These Additional European Terms apply only if Customer has end users in the
European Economic Area (“EEA”) or Switzerland.

-   **End Users in EEA or Switzerland**. Terms used in the DPT that are not
    specifically defined will have the meaning in Directive 95/46/EC of the
    European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection
    of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the
    free movement of such data (the “EU Data Protection Directive”).

-   **Intent of the Parties**. For the Online Services, Microsoft is a data
    processor (or sub-processor) acting on Customer’s behalf. As data processor
    (or sub-processor), Microsoft will only act upon Customer’s instructions.
    The OST and Customer’s volume licensing agreement (including the terms and
    conditions incorporated by reference therein), along with Customer’s use and
    configuration of features in the Online Services, are Customer’s complete
    and final instructions to Microsoft for the processing of Customer Data. Any
    additional or alternate instructions must be agreed to according to the
    process for amending Customer’s volume licensing agreement.

-   **Duration and Object of Data Processing**. The duration of data processing
    shall be for the term designated under Customer’s volume licensing
    agreement. The objective of the data processing is the performance of the
    Online Services.

-   **Scope and Purpose of Data Processing**. The scope and purpose of
    processing of Customer Data, including any personal data included in the
    Customer Data, is described in the DPT and Customer’s volume licensing
    agreement.

-   **Customer Data Access**. For the term designated under Customer’s volume
    licensing agreement Microsoft will, at its election and as necessary under
    applicable law implementing Article 12(b) of the EU Data Protection
    Directive, either: (1) provide Customer with the ability to correct, delete,
    or block Customer Data, or (2) make such corrections, deletions, or
    blockages on Customer’s behalf.

Security

-   **General Practices**. Microsoft has implemented and will maintain and
    follow for the Online Services the following security measures, which, in

*\*Does not include Microsoft Social Engagement.*

\*\**Current scope is detailed in the audit report and summarized in the
Microsoft Azure Trust Center.*

Microsoft may add industry or government standards at any time. Microsoft will
not eliminate a standard or framework in the table above, unless it is no longer
used in the industry and it is replaced with a successor (if any). Azure
Government Services meet a separate set of control standards and frameworks, as
detailed on the Microsoft Azure Trust Center.

Subject to non-disclosure obligations, Microsoft will make each Information
Security Policy available to Customer, along with other information reasonably
requested by Customer regarding Microsoft security practices and policies.

Customer is solely responsible for reviewing each Information Security Policy
and making an independent determination as to whether it meets Customer’s
requirements.

If the Standard Contractual Clauses apply, then this section is in addition to
Clause 5 paragraph f and Clause 12 paragraph 2 of the Standard Contractual
Clauses.

**Microsoft Audits of Online Services**

For each Online Service, Microsoft will conduct audits of the security of the
computers, computing environment and physical data centers that it uses in
processing Customer Data (including personal data), as follows:

-   Where a standard or framework provides for audits, an audit of such control
    standard or framework will be initiated at least annually for each Online
    Service.

-   Each audit will be performed according to the standards and rules of the
    regulatory or accreditation body for each applicable control standard or
    framework.

-   Each audit will be performed by qualified, independent, third party security
    auditors at Microsoft’s selection and expense.

Each audit will result in the generation of an audit report (“Microsoft Audit
Report”), which will be Microsoft’s Confidential Information. The Microsoft
Audit Report will clearly disclose any material findings by the auditor.
Microsoft will promptly remediate issues raised in any Microsoft Audit Report to
the satisfaction of the auditor.

If Customer requests, Microsoft will provide Customer with each Microsoft Audit
Report so that Customer can verify Microsoft’s compliance with the security
obligations under the DPT. The Microsoft Audit Report will be subject to
non-disclosure and distribution limitations of Microsoft and the auditor.

If the Standard Contractual Clauses apply, then (1) Customer agrees to exercise
its audit right by instructing Microsoft to execute the audit as described in
this section of the DPT, and (2) if Customer desires to change this instruction,
then Customer has the right to do so as set forth in the Standard Contractual
Clauses, which shall be requested in writing.

If the Standard Contractual Clauses apply, then nothing in this section of the
DPT varies or modifies the Standard Contractual Clauses or affects any
supervisory authority’s or data subject’s rights under the Standard Contractual
Clauses. Microsoft Corporation is an intended third-party beneficiary of this
section.

Customer must notify each user of a Calling Plan that Emergency Services operate
differently than on traditional telephone services in the following ways: (i)
Office 365 may not know the actual location of an Emergency Services caller,
which could result in the call being routed to the wrong Emergency Services call
center and/or emergency services being dispatched to the wrong location; (ii) if
the user’s device has no power, is experiencing a power outage or, for any
reason, cannot otherwise access the Internet, the user cannot make an Emergency
Services call through a Calling Plan service; and (iii) although Calling Plan
services can be used anywhere in the world where an Internet connection is
available, users should not make an Emergency Services call from a location
outside their home country because the call likely will not be routed to the
appropriate call center in that location.

Professional Services

Customer may be eligible for Microsoft customer support and consulting services
related to this Online Service. These services are “Professional Services” under
Customer’s volume licensing agreement. If Customer’s volume licensing agreement
covers Online Services only (and does not define Professional Services), then
these services are provided subject to the “Professional Services Terms” below.
If, however, Professional Services are included in a separate agreement, then
the terms of that separate agreement will apply.

The Professional Services to which this Notice applies are not Online Services,
and the rest of the Online Services Terms, as well as any data processing
amendment or HIPAA Business Associate Agreement signed by the parties, do not
apply. Any information provided to Microsoft in connection with these
Professional Services is protected under the confidentiality terms of Customer's
volume licensing agreement.

Additional terms in the Online Services Terms may apply to these Professional
Services, but only to the extent those terms don’t conflict with this Notice.

**Professional Services Terms**

>   **Definition**

>   Any services to which this notice applies are defined, collectively, as
>   “Professional Services”.

>   **Processing of Personal Data**

>   To the extent Microsoft is a processor or subprocessor of Personal Data in
>   connection with the provision of Professional Services, Microsoft makes the
>   commitments in the GDPR Terms in Attachment 4 to all customers effective May
>   25, 2018.

>   **Obligations of the Parties**

>   Microsoft warrants that all Professional Services will be performed with
>   professional care and skill. If Microsoft fails to do so and Customer
>   notifies Microsoft within 90 days of the date of performance, then Microsoft
>   will either re-perform the Professional Services or return the price paid
>   for them as Customer’s sole remedy for breach of the Professional Services
>   warranty.

>   Customer will perform its applicable responsibilities and obligations to
>   support Microsoft’s performance of the Professional Services, as specified
>   in the description of each Professional Service.

>   **Limitation of Liability**

>   To the extent permitted by applicable law, each party’s total liability for
>   all claims relating to Professional Services will be limited to the amounts
>   Customer was required to pay for the Professional Services or the limitation
>   of liability for the Online Service with which the Professional Services are
>   offered, whichever is greater. **In no event will either party be liable for
>   indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or consequential damages, including
>   loss of use, loss of profits, or interruption of business, however caused or
>   on any theory of liability in relation to the Professional Services. No
>   limitation or exclusions will apply to liability arising out of either
>   party’s (1) confidentiality obligations; or (2) violation of the other
>   party’s intellectual property rights.**

>   **Fixes**

>   “Fixes” are Product fixes, modifications or enhancements, or their
>   derivatives, that Microsoft either releases generally (such as service
>   packs) or that Microsoft provides to Customer to address a specific issue.
>   Each Fix, is licensed under the same terms as the Product to which it
>   applies. If a Fix is not provided for a specific Product, any use terms
>   Microsoft provides with the Fix will apply.

>   **Pre-Existing Work**

>   “Pre-Existing Work” means any computer code or non-code based written
>   materials developed or otherwise obtained independent of Customer’s volume
>   licensing agreement. All rights in Pre-Existing Work shall remain the sole
>   property of the party providing the Pre-Existing Work. Each party may use,
>   reproduce and modify the other party’s Pre-Existing Work only as needed to
>   perform obligations related to Professional Services.

>   **Services Deliverables**

>   “Services Deliverables” means any computer code or materials other than
>   Products or Fixes that Microsoft leaves with Customer at the conclusion of
>   Microsoft’s performance of Professional Services. Microsoft grants Customer
>   a non-exclusive, non-transferable, perpetual license to reproduce, use, and
>   modify the Services Deliverables solely for Customer’s internal business
>   purposes, subject to the terms and conditions in Customer’s volume licensing
>   agreement.

>   **Non-Microsoft Technology**

>   Customer is solely responsible for any non-Microsoft software or technology
>   that it installs or uses with the Online Services, Fixes, or Services
>   Deliverables.

>   **Affiliates’ Rights**

>   Customer may sublicense the rights to use Services Deliverables to its
>   Affiliates, but Customer’s Affiliates may not sublicense these rights.
>   Customer is liable for ensuring its Affiliates’ compliance with the terms of
>   this Notice and Customer’s volume licensing agreement.

>   any and all entitlement to compensation from Customer for the Professional
>   Services. In compliance with applicable laws and regulations, Microsoft and
>   Customer acknowledge that the Professional Services are for the sole benefit
>   and use of Customer and not provided for the personal use or benefit of any
>   individual government employee.

Attachment 3 – The Standard Contractual Clauses (Processors)

For the purposes of Article 26(2) of Directive 95/46/EC for the transfer of
personal data to processors established in third countries which do not ensure
an adequate level of data protection, Customer (as data exporter) and Microsoft
Corporation (as data importer, whose signature appears below), each a “party,”
together “the parties,” have agreed on the following Contractual Clauses (the
“Clauses” or “Standard Contractual Clauses”) in order to adduce adequate
safeguards with respect to the protection of privacy and fundamental rights and
freedoms of individuals for the transfer by the data exporter to the data
importer of the personal data specified in Appendix 1.

**Clause 1: Definitions**

(a) 'personal data', 'special categories of data', 'process/processing',
'controller', 'processor', 'data subject' and 'supervisory authority' shall have
the same meaning as in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the
processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data;

(b) 'the data exporter' means the controller who transfers the personal data;

(c) 'the data importer' means the processor who agrees to receive from the data
exporter personal data intended for processing on his behalf after the transfer
in accordance with his instructions and the terms of the Clauses and who is not
subject to a third country's system ensuring adequate protection within the
meaning of Article 25(1) of Directive 95/46/EC;

(d) 'the subprocessor' means any processor engaged by the data importer or by
any other subprocessor of the data importer who agrees to receive from the data
importer or from any other subprocessor of the data importer personal data
exclusively intended for processing activities to be carried out on behalf of
the data exporter after the transfer in accordance with his instructions, the
terms of the Clauses and the terms of the written subcontract;

(e) 'the applicable data protection law' means the legislation protecting the
fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals and, in particular, their right
to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data applicable to a data
controller in the Member State in which the data exporter is established;

(f) 'technical and organisational security measures' means those measures aimed
at protecting personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or
accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, in particular
where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and
against all other unlawful forms of processing.

**Clause 2: Details of the transfer**

The details of the transfer and in particular the special categories of personal
data where applicable are specified in Appendix 1 below which forms an integral
part of the Clauses.

**Clause 3: Third-party beneficiary clause**

1. The data subject can enforce against the data exporter this Clause, Clause
4(b) to (i), Clause 5(a) to (e), and (g) to (j), Clause 6(1) and (2), Clause 7,
Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12 as third-party beneficiary.

2. The data subject can enforce against the data importer this Clause, Clause
5(a) to (e) and (g), Clause 6, Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12, in
cases where the data exporter has factually disappeared or has ceased to exist
in law unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of
the data exporter by contract or by operation of law, as a result of which it
takes on the rights and obligations of the data exporter, in which case the data
subject can enforce them against such entity.

3. The data subject can enforce against the subprocessor this Clause, Clause
5(a) to (e) and (g), Clause 6, Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12, in
cases where both the data exporter and the data importer have factually
disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, unless any
successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter
by contract or by operation of law as a result of which it takes on the rights
and obligations of the data exporter, in which case the data subject can enforce
them against such entity. Such third-party liability of the subprocessor shall
be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.

4. The parties do not object to a data subject being represented by an
association or other body if the data subject so expressly wishes and if
permitted by national law.

**Clause 4: Obligations of the data exporter**

The data exporter agrees and warrants:

(a) that the processing, including the transfer itself, of the personal data has
been and will continue to be carried out in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the applicable data protection law (and, where applicable, has
been notified to the relevant authorities of the Member State where the data
exporter is established) and does not violate the relevant provisions of that
State;

(b) that it has instructed and throughout the duration of the personal data
processing services will instruct the data importer to process the personal data
transferred only on the data exporter's behalf and in accordance with the
applicable data protection law and the Clauses;

(c) that the data importer will provide sufficient guarantees in respect of the
technical and organisational security measures specified in Appendix 2 below;

(d) that after assessment of the requirements of the applicable data protection
law, the security measures are appropriate to protect personal data against
accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised
disclosure or access, in particular where the processing involves the
transmission of data over a network, and against all other unlawful forms of
processing, and that these measures ensure a level of security appropriate to
the risks presented by the processing and the nature of the data to be protected
having regard to the state of the art and the cost of their implementation;

(e) that it will ensure compliance with the security measures;

(f) that, if the transfer involves special categories of data, the data subject
has been informed or will be informed before, or as soon as possible after, the
transfer that its data could be transmitted to a third country not providing
adequate protection within the meaning of Directive 95/46/EC;

(g) to forward any notification received from the data importer or any
subprocessor pursuant to Clause 5(b) and Clause 8(3) to the data protection
supervisory authority if the data exporter decides to continue the transfer or
to lift the suspension;

(h) to make available to the data subjects upon request a copy of the Clauses,
with the exception of Appendix 2, and a summary description of the security
measures, as well as a copy of any contract for subprocessing services which has
to be made in accordance with the Clauses, unless the Clauses or the contract
contain commercial information, in which case it may remove such commercial
information;

(i) that, in the event of subprocessing, the processing activity is carried out
in accordance with Clause 11 by a subprocessor providing at least the same level
of protection for the personal data and the rights of data subject as the data
importer under the Clauses; and

(j) that it will ensure compliance with Clause 4(a) to (i).

**Clause 5: Obligations of the data importer**

The data importer agrees and warrants:

(a) to process the personal data only on behalf of the data exporter and in
compliance with its instructions and the Clauses; if it cannot provide such
compliance for whatever reasons, it agrees to inform promptly the data exporter
of its inability to comply, in which case the data exporter is entitled to
suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract;

(b) that it has no reason to believe that the legislation applicable to it
prevents it from fulfilling the instructions received from the data exporter and
its obligations under the contract and that in the event of a change in this
legislation which is likely to have a substantial adverse effect on the
warranties and obligations provided by the Clauses, it will promptly notify the
change to the data exporter as soon as it is aware, in which case the data
exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the
contract;

(c) that it has implemented the technical and organisational security measures
specified in Appendix 2 before processing the personal data transferred;

(d) that it will promptly notify the data exporter about:

>   (i) any legally binding request for disclosure of the personal data by a law
>   enforcement authority unless otherwise prohibited, such as a prohibition
>   under criminal law to preserve the confidentiality of a law enforcement
>   investigation,

>   (ii) any accidental or unauthorised access, and

>   (iii) any request received directly from the data subjects without
>   responding to that request, unless it has been otherwise authorised to do
>   so;

(e) to deal promptly and properly with all inquiries from the data exporter
relating to its processing of the personal data subject to the transfer and to
abide by the advice of the supervisory authority with regard to the processing
of the data transferred;

(f) at the request of the data exporter to submit its data processing facilities
for audit of the processing activities covered by the Clauses which shall be
carried out by the data exporter or an inspection body composed of independent
members and in possession of the required professional qualifications bound by a
duty of confidentiality, selected by the data exporter, where applicable, in
agreement with the supervisory authority;

(g) to make available to the data subject upon request a copy of the Clauses, or
any existing contract for subprocessing, unless the Clauses or contract contain
commercial information, in which case it may remove such commercial information,
with the exception of Appendix 2 which shall be replaced by a summary
description of the security measures in those cases where the data subject is
unable to obtain a copy from the data exporter;

(h) that, in the event of subprocessing, it has previously informed the data
exporter and obtained its prior written consent;

(i) that the processing services by the subprocessor will be carried out in
accordance with Clause 11; and

(j) to send promptly a copy of any subprocessor agreement it concludes under the
Clauses to the data exporter.

**Clause 6: Liability**

1. The parties agree that any data subject who has suffered damage as a result
of any breach of the obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 by any
party or subprocessor is entitled to receive compensation from the data exporter
for the damage suffered.

2. If a data subject is not able to bring a claim for compensation in accordance
with paragraph 1 against the data exporter, arising out of a breach by the data
importer or his subprocessor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3
or in Clause 11, because the data exporter has factually disappeared or ceased
to exist in law or has become insolvent, the data importer agrees that the data
subject may issue a claim against the data importer as if it were the data
exporter, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations
of the data exporter by contract of by operation of law, in which case the data
subject can enforce its rights against such entity.

The data importer may not rely on a breach by a subprocessor of its obligations
in order to avoid its own liabilities.

3. If a data subject is not able to bring a claim against the data exporter or
the data importer referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, arising out of a breach by
the subprocessor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in
Clause 11 because both the data exporter and the data importer have factually
disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, the subprocessor
agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data subprocessor
with regard to its own processing operations under the Clauses as if it were the
data exporter or the data importer, unless any successor entity has assumed the
entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by
operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against
such entity. The liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own
processing operations under the Clauses.

**Clause 7: Mediation and jurisdiction**

1. The data importer agrees that if the data subject invokes against it
third-party beneficiary rights and/or claims compensation for damages under the
Clauses, the data importer will accept the decision of the data subject:

>   (a) to refer the dispute to mediation, by an independent person or, where
>   applicable, by the supervisory authority;

>   (b) to refer the dispute to the courts in the Member State in which the data
>   exporter is established.

2. The parties agree that the choice made by the data subject will not prejudice
its substantive or procedural rights to seek remedies in accordance with other
provisions of national or international law.

**Clause 8: Cooperation with supervisory authorities**

1. The data exporter agrees to deposit a copy of this contract with the
supervisory authority if it so requests or if such deposit is required under the
applicable data protection law.

2. The parties agree that the supervisory authority has the right to conduct an
audit of the data importer, and of any subprocessor, which has the same scope
and is subject to the same conditions as would apply to an audit of the data
exporter under the applicable data protection law.

3. The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter about the existence
of legislation applicable to it or any subprocessor preventing the conduct of an
audit of the data importer, or any subprocessor, pursuant to paragraph 2. In
such a case the data exporter shall be entitled to take the measures foreseen in
Clause 5 (b).

**Clause 9: Governing Law.**

The Clauses shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data
exporter is established.

**Clause 10: Variation of the contract**

The parties undertake not to vary or modify the Clauses. This does not preclude
the parties from adding clauses on business related issues where required as
long as they do not contradict the Clause.

**Clause 11: Subprocessing**

1. The data importer shall not subcontract any of its processing operations
performed on behalf of the data exporter under the Clauses without the prior
written consent of the data exporter. Where the data importer subcontracts its
obligations under the Clauses, with the consent of the data exporter, it shall
do so only by way of a written agreement with the subprocessor which imposes the
same obligations on the subprocessor as are imposed on the data importer under
the Clauses. Where the subprocessor fails to fulfil its data protection
obligations under such written agreement the data importer shall remain fully
liable to the data exporter for the performance of the subprocessor's
obligations under such agreement.

2. The prior written contract between the data importer and the subprocessor
shall also provide for a third-party beneficiary clause as laid down in Clause 3
for cases where the data subject is not able to bring the claim for compensation
referred to in paragraph 1 of Clause 6 against the data exporter or the data
importer because they have factually disappeared or have ceased to exist in law
or have become insolvent and no successor entity has assumed the entire legal
obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of
law. Such third-party liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own
processing operations under the Clauses.

3. The provisions relating to data protection aspects for subprocessing of the
contract referred to in paragraph 1 shall be governed by the law of the Member
State in which the data exporter is established.

4. The data exporter shall keep a list of subprocessing agreements concluded
under the Clauses and notified by the data importer pursuant to Clause 5 (j),
which shall be updated at least once a year. The list shall be available to the
data exporter's data protection supervisory authority.

**Clause 12: Obligation after the termination of personal data processing
services**

1. The parties agree that on the termination of the provision of data processing
services, the data importer and the subprocessor shall, at the choice of the
data exporter, return all the personal data transferred and the copies thereof
to the data exporter or shall destroy all the personal data and certify to the
data exporter that it has done so, unless legislation imposed upon the data
importer prevents it from returning or destroying all or part of the personal
data transferred. In that case, the data importer warrants that it will
guarantee the confidentiality of the personal data transferred and will not
actively process the personal data transferred anymore.

2. The data importer and the subprocessor warrant that upon request of the data
exporter and/or of the supervisory authority, it will submit its data processing
facilities for an audit of the measures referred to in paragraph 1.

Attachment 4 – European Union General Data Protection Regulation Terms

**A. Definitions**

Terms used but not defined in these GDPR Terms, such as “personal data breach”,
“processing”, “controller”, “processor” and “data subject”, will have the same
meaning as set forth in Article 4 of the GDPR.

The following definition is also used in these GDPR Terms:

**“Subprocessors”** means the other processors that are used by Microsoft to
process Personal Data.

**B. Roles and Scope**

>   **1.** These GDPR Terms apply to the processing of Personal Data, within the
>   scope of the GDPR, by Microsoft on behalf of Customer.

>   **2.** For purposes of these GDPR Terms, Customer and Microsoft agree that
>   Customer is the controller of Customer Personal Data and Microsoft is the
>   processor of such data, except when Customer acts as a processor of Personal
>   Data, in which case Microsoft is a subprocessor.

>   **3.** These GDPR Terms do not limit or reduce any data protection
>   commitments Microsoft makes to Customer in the OST or other agreement
>   between Microsoft and Customer.

>   **4.** These GDPR Terms do not apply where Microsoft is a controller of
>   Personal Data.

**C. Relevant GDPR Obligations: Articles 28, 32, and 33**

>   **1.** Microsoft shall not engage another processor without prior specific
>   or general written authorisation of Customer. In the case of general written
>   authorisation, Microsoft shall inform Customer of any intended changes
>   concerning the addition or replacement of other processors, thereby giving
>   Customer the opportunity to object to such changes. (Article 28(2))

>   **2.** Processing by Microsoft shall be governed by these GDPR Terms under
>   European Union (hereafter “Union”) or Member State law and are binding on
>   Microsoft with regard to Customer. The subject-matter and duration of the
>   processing, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of Personal
>   Data, the categories of data subjects and the obligations and rights of the
>   Customer are set forth in the Customer’s volume licensing agreement,
>   including these GDPR Terms. In particular, Microsoft shall:

>   **(a)** process the Personal Data only on documented instructions from
>   Customer, including with regard to transfers of Personal Data to a third
>   country or an international organisation, unless required to do so by Union
>   or Member State law to which Microsoft is subject; in such a case, Microsoft
>   shall inform Customer of that legal requirement before processing, unless
>   that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest;

>   **(b)** ensure that persons authorised to process the Personal Data have
>   committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate
>   statutory obligation of confidentiality;

>   **(c)** take all measures required pursuant to Article 32 of the GDPR;

>   **(d)** respect the conditions referred to in paragraphs 1 and 3 for
>   engaging another processor;

>   **(e)** taking into account the nature of the processing, assist Customer by
>   appropriate technical and organisational measures, insofar as this is
>   possible, for the fulfilment of the Customer’s obligation to respond to
>   requests for exercising the data subject's rights laid down in Chapter III
>   of the GDPR;

>   **(f)** assist Customer in ensuring compliance with the obligations pursuant
>   to Articles 32 to 36 of the GDPR, taking into account the nature of
>   processing and the information available to Microsoft;

>   **(g)** at the choice of Customer, delete or return all the Personal Data to
>   Customer after the end of the provision of services relating to processing,
>   and delete existing copies unless Union or Member State law requires storage
>   of the Personal Data;

>   **(h)** make available to Customer all information necessary to demonstrate
>   compliance with the obligations laid down in Article 28 of the GDPR and
>   allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections, conducted by
>   Customer or another auditor mandated by Customer.

>   Microsoft shall immediately inform Customer if, in its opinion, an
>   instruction infringes the GDPR or other Union or Member State data
>   protection provisions. (Article 28(3))

>   **3.** Where Microsoft engages another processor for carrying out specific
>   processing activities on behalf of Customer, the same data protection
>   obligations as set out in these GDPR Terms shall be imposed on that other
>   processor by way of a contract or other legal act under Union or Member
>   State law, in particular providing sufficient guarantees to implement
>   appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that the
>   processing will meet the requirements of the GDPR. Where that other
>   processor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations, Microsoft shall
>   remain fully liable to the Customer for the performance of that other
>   processor's obligations. (Article 28(4))

>   **4.** Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation
>   and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the
>   risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of
>   natural persons, Customer and Microsoft shall implement appropriate
>   technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security
>   appropriate to the risk, including inter alia as appropriate:

>   **(a)** the pseudonymisation and encryption of Personal Data;

>   **(b)** the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity,
>   availability and resilience of processing systems and services;

>   **(c)** the ability to restore the availability and access to Personal Data
>   in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident; and

>   **(d)** a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the
>   effectiveness of technical and organisational measures for ensuring the
>   security of the processing. (Article 32(1))

>   **5.** In assessing the appropriate level of security, account shall be
>   taken of the risks that are presented by processing, in particular from
>   accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised
>   disclosure of, or access to Personal Data transmitted, stored or otherwise
>   processed. (Article 32(2))

>   **6.** Customer and Microsoft shall take steps to ensure that any natural
>   person acting under the authority of Customer or Microsoft who has access to
>   Personal Data does not process them except on instructions from Customer,
>   unless he or she is required to do so by Union or Member State law. (Article
>   32(4))

>   **7.** Microsoft shall notify Customer without undue delay after becoming
>   aware of a personal data breach. (Article 33(2). Such notice will, at a
>   minimum,

>   **(a)** describe the nature of the personal data breach including where
>   possible, the categories and approximate number of data subjects concerned
>   and the categories and approximate number of Personal Data records
>   concerned;

>   **(b)** communicate the name and contact details of the data protection
>   officer or other contact where more information can be obtained;

>   **(c)** describe the likely consequences of the personal data breach; and

>   **(d)** describe the measures taken or proposed to be taken by the
>   controller to address the personal data breach, including, where
>   appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects. (Article
>   33(3))
