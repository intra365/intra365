For example, WIP could prevent sensitive internal or external data from being accidentally posted to a public social app. WIP essentially distinguishes between corporate and personal information and encrypts data according to rules or policies set by IT. With WIP, this all happens under the hood, unseen by the user. Users only get notifications when they’re attempting to take an unauthorized action, so they aren’t distracted or interrupted by policies.

Office 365 Groups is a feature developed with collaboration in mind. A group includes a shared workspace for email, conversations, files, and calendar events so group members can communicate, collaborate, and quickly get stuff done.\n\nEvery Office 365 Group comes with a connected OneNote shared notebook. Your team can use this notebook to go back and review ideas, meeting notes, and product information they've compiled together.\n\n[View Training](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Learn-about-Office-365-groups-b565caa1-5c40-40ef-9915-60fdb2d97fa2?ui=en-US&rs=en-001&ad=US)",

Depending on your organization's Office 365 subscription, your workers might have access to collaboration resources, communication channels, file sharing, and more. StaffHub provisions an **Office 365 group** for every team that is created, allowing you to easily set up a collection of resources for your workers to share. You don't have to worry about manually assigning permissions to all those resources, because adding members to the group automatically gives them the permissions they need to the tools the group provides.\n\n[View Training](https://support.office.com/article/Let-Microsoft-StaffHub-provision-accounts-for-deskless-workers-22ef209e-603c-4b32-98a0-4a9a9b50eec9)",

Windows Defender ATP uses behavior learning to detect attacks that have made it past all other defenses. That means that as the service runs on end users’ devices, it learns how to distinguish between normal and abnormal behavior for your organization. It draws on real-time and historic information to identify attacks and expose previously undetected threats, providing actionable alerts for known and unknown adversaries. A security operations console provides IT with an easy way to investigate alerts, proactively explore the network for signs of attacks, perform forensics of specific machines, track attacker actions across machines in the network, and get a detailed file footprint across the organization.\n\n[View Training](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/threat-protection/windows-defender-atp/windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection)",
